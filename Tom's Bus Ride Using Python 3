One time, by bus, Tom was heading home. He found the number on his bus seat was not blessed. A blessed seat is a six-digit seat number, in which the sum of its first three digits is equivalent to the total of the last three digits.

For example, number 165912 is considered blessed because sum of 1+6+5 = 12, and 9+1+2=12.

Since the number on the seat was not blessed, Tom needs your help to find the next blessed seat number.

For example, if Tom's ticket number is 165901, then the next lucky ticket number is 165903.

Given Tom's current seat number, find and print the next blessed seat number.
